## Getting Started

Node Version Manager (NVM) is recommended to maintain node version consistency with dependencies. If you don't already have NVM set up on your computer, use [this guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to get started. To specify the node version in the `.nvmrc` file:

```
nvm use
```

Then install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Format

This project uses Prettier for code formatting. To format all files:

```
yarn format
```
